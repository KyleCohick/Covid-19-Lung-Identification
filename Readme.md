### Project was completed: May 2020

## Introduction
The coronavirus, Covid-19, has had a tremendous global effect. Countries around the world are scrambling to develop and produce enough tests to keep up with the rates of infection. The goal of this project is to use two databases of x-ray images of patient's lungs to build a classifier that can detect whether or not a person has Covid-19 or is healthy. To the naked eye, the images may be hard to tell apart, but it's possible that deep learning methods will be better at discerning the difference than the naked eye.  
  
## Conclusion
To anyone coming to read this project, I present this model as proof that given a much larger database, which hospitals or other medical institutions might have, an extremely accurate model could be created to help assist doctors in identifying Covid-19 in a non-invase procedure. The final model achieved 95%-100% accuracy on test data and while I do not believe this model should be immediately put into use in the field right now, I do believe that this represents a very promising start for medical AI research going forward against Covid-19.
